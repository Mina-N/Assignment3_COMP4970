# Assignment3_COMP4970

To run main.cpp, which contains the updated web crawler code from Assignment 1, place both the main.cpp and getWebPage.class files in the same directory. Create a new directory on the same level as the previous two files named html_source. After execution, main.cpp should produce a file called feature_vectors.txt that contains feature vectors for the web pages that were expanded during execution.
